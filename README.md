# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction_ML_Project
This project predicts medical insurance costs for individuals based on personal and lifestyle factors using Linear Regression.
The model helps insurance companies and individuals estimate expected medical expenses and make informed decisions.
The prediction is based on factors like age, BMI, gender, smoking habits, and number of children.

Features:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling categorical variables (one-hot encoding)
4. Training a Linear Regression model
5. Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² score
6. Prediction on new data

Machine Learning Algorithm:
--> Used Linear Regression
Why Linear Regression?
** Simple and interpretable
** Predicts continuous numeric values
** Works well for relationships between independent variables and the target variable

Model Evaluation:
The model performance is evaluated using:
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. R² Score
